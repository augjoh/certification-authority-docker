== Images

To ease setup the certification authority, container images are provided.
Currently there are two flavours of images: `master` and `development`.

master::
  The latest stable software release. It has been tested and undergone the full
  release process.
development::
  This flavour contains the latest software, and flows. Although it might contain
  more bugs, than `master`. It is intended for developers, only.

=== Non x86-64 images

There are unofficial docker images on
`https://hub.docker.com/r/platynum/certification-authority`
which run on BeagleBone, Raspberry PI, and other ARM- or i686-based
hardware. These images are rebuilt daily with the `master` branch of the
flows.

WARNING: The unofficial images are not tested in any way, currently.
