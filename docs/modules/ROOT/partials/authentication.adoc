== Authentication

The user interface (UI) of the CA is protected via Client Certificate
Authentication (CCA). The reverse proxy in front of Node-RED will check, if
the client uses a certificate issued by an `Admin` certification authority.

NOTE: The `Admin` certification authority is created on startup of the
  container, but an authentication certificate has to be created manually.

The remainder of this page explains, how to generate a certificate and to import
it into a browser.

=== Create PKCS12/PFX file

After creating the key and a corresponding certificate, these have to be
combined into a PKCS12/PFX file. To combine them you have to enter the
container first:

[tabs]
====
Docker::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
$ docker exec -it node-red sh
----
--
====

Afterwards you can create the PKCS12/PFX file inside your container. Replace the
highlighted password with an appropriate one.

[source,shell]
----
$ cd /data/Admin
$ CAFILE=$(mktemp)
$ cat */ca.crt.pem ../Root/*/ca.crt.pem >${CAFILE}
$ openssl pkcs12 -in    ??[a-f0-9]*/??[a-f0-9]*.crt.pem \
                 -inkey ??[a-f0-9]*/??[a-f0-9]*.priv.key.pem \
                 -export -out Admin.pfx -chain -CAfile ${CAFILE} -password pass:##password##
$ rm ${CAFILE}
----

Download the PKCS12/PFX file from the certification authority container onto
your host system next.

[tabs]
====
Docker::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
$ docker cp node-red:/data/Admin/Admin.pfx .
----
--
====

Now you'll have to import the generated PKCS12/PFX file into your browser.

== Import PKCS12/PFX file

To import a PKCS12/PFX file into the certificate store of your operating system,
you can use the following command:

[tabs]
====
Windows Powershell::
+
--
[source,powershell]
----
PS C:\>$mypwd = Get-Credential -UserName 'Enter password below' `
                               -Message 'Enter password below'
PS C:\>Import-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\Admin.pfx `
                             -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My `
                             -Password $mypwd.Password
