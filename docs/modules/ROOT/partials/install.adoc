= Installation

== Pre-requisites

To install the container you'll need a container runtime. This can
be `docker(1)`, `podman(1)`, or a similar container runtime. In the
remainder of this document it is expected, that you're familiar with
docker.

=== Docker

To install the docker container runtime on your machine, choose among
of the following commands according to your operating system /
distribution.

[tabs]
====
Debian/Ubuntu::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo apt install docker-io
----
--
OpenSuSE/SLES::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo zypper install docker
----
--
Manjaro/Archlinux::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo pacman -S docker
----
--
====

After installation you might have to start the `docker(8)` daemon:
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo systemctl start docker
$ sudo systemctl enable docker
----

=== Podman

On RedHat / CentOS there is no docker package available by default.
You can use `podman(1)` here to run the container. At first install
the container runtime:

[tabs]
====
RedHat/CentOS::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo dnf install podman
----
--
====

There is no daemon to be started, so you're done, already.

== Downloading the image

After you have installed the docker runtime, you'll be able to download
the container of this project.

At first choose the image you want to download:
[source,bash]
----
$ IMAGE=registry.gitlab.com/platynum/certification-authority/container:latest
----

And download it with `docker(1)`: footnote:[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_pull/]

TIP: Your user might need to be part of the `docker` group to use the `docker(1)` command line utility!

[tabs]
====
Docker::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
$ docker image pull ${IMAGE}
----
--
Podman::
+
--
If you're using `podman(1)` as your container runtime, you can use `podman-pull(1)`. footnote:[http://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-pull.1.html]
[source,bash]
----
$ podman pull ${IMAGE}
----
--
====

=== Non x86-64 images

The registry hosted at gitlab.com provides container images for `amd64`, `arm`,
and `aarch64`.

There are additional unofficial docker images on
`https://hub.docker.com/r/platynum/certification-authority`
which run on BeagleBone, Raspberry PI, and other ARM- or i686-based
hardware. These images are rebuilt daily.

WARNING: The unofficial images are not tested in any way, currently.
